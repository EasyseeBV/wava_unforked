  Description: "Shaun Motsi, born 1989 in Harare, ZWE, studied Fine Art at the St\xE4delschule
    in Frankfurt am Main until 2020. He won the Sammlung Pohl Graduate Prize in 2020
    as well as the St\xE4delschule\u2019s Colliers International Rundgang Prize.
    His work has been included in numerous group exhibitions at such venues as Elvira,
    Frankfurt am Main, DE (2021), Shedhalle, Zurich, CH (2020), Portikus, Frankfurt
    am Main, DE (2020), PS120, Berlin, DE (2019), TOR Art Space, Frankfurt am Main,
    DE (2018), and the IX Berlin Biennale, Berlin, DE (2016). He has had solo exhibitions
    at Page NYC, New York, USA (2019) and PSM, Berlin, DE (2017), among others. Using
    painting, installation, and text, Shaun Motsi examines various aspects of cultural
    narratives and how they interconnect in a global context. His works focus on
    the question of how knowledge and information are transmitted and received across
    temporal and geographical spaces. They reference everyday things, western pop
    culture, and the artist\u2019s own experiences. Questions about the representation
    of blackness in relation to neoliberal-capitalist western culture play a role
    in his artistic practice, as does the blurring of the boundary between identity
    and aesthetics qua representation."

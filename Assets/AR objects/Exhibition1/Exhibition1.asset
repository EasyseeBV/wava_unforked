  Description: "The Anlage\u201D is composed of six artworks encompassing some of
    the wide spectra of possibilities expanded by virtual interventions into physical
    space. Shaun Motsi (*1989, Harare, ZW) planted a tree from the Avatar movie in
    the middle of the Nizza Garden\u2013\u2013Untitled (N\xFC Sensitivity) (2021).
    Also in Nizza, Tanya V. Abelson (*1985, Buenos Aires, AR) composed Tambourine
    (2021), a music piece for the imported plants planted along the path. Towards
    Willy- Brandt-Platz, beside the banking district, Alex Chalmers (*1991, Whang\u0101rei,
    Aotearoa/NZ) presents Untitled (2022), a digital elevator cabin that now appears
    cut out among the skyscrapers which once encapsulated it. Across the street,
    Benedikt Ackermann (*1994, Frankfurt, DE) thought an AI machine to identify manholes,
    the underground shafts holding the cables which are the base of our virtual life
    itself, in a work titled Embedded systems (2022). In the middle of the park,
    Florian Adolph (*1977, Marburg, DE) placed two massive virtual sculptures, Paper
    and Stele (both 2019), and on a small hilltop in front of the Deutsche Bank towers,
    Kristin Reiman\u2019s (*1992, Tallinn, EE) work How to unfocus completely (2022)
    plays out of two virtual speakers."

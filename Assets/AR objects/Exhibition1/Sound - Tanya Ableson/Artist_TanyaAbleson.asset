  Description: "Tanya V. Abelson graduated from St\xE4delschule in Frankfurt am Main
    in 2018 with a meisterschule with professor Douglas Gordon. The sculptures and
    instrumental sculptures from Abelson, combine materials seeking in their elasticity
    or hardness, the limits possible for its transmutation. Through burning, stretching,
    cutting and reassembling leather, rubber, tires, paraffin and metal, Abelson
    searched for playful ensembles that embody the tension and keep open their unsolved
    nature. In 2021, in collaboration with artist and composer Billy Bultheel, created
    -Unter- a concert and performance in three acts, as part of Disappearing Berlin
    by Schinkel Pavillon x Radialsystem at Wellenbad Spreewaldplatz Berlin. Abelson
    solo exhibitions include Gravity at Hofskulptur in Haus am L\xFCtzowplatz, Berlin
    with the concert -Prelude- with Alexander Iezzi in 2020. Silver Glaze at Nassauischer
    Kunstverein Wiesbaden in 2019 with a concert by musician Daniele de Santis. Also
    took part in group exhibitions at the Frankfurter Kunstverein, Museum Art Plus,
    Kunstverein G\xF6ttingen, among others."

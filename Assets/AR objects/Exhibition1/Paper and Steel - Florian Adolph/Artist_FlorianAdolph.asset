  Description: "Florian Adolph (*1977, lives in Frankfurt) studied Interdisciplinary
    Art and Fine Painting at the St\xE4delschule in Frankfurt am Main. Since 2006,
    he has been exploring the conditions of human perception in a media context.
    His visual language deliberately oscillates between abstraction and representationalism,
    thereby challenging patterns of perception. Against this backdrop, he develops
    new interdisciplinary artistic production methods. In his recent works, Florian
    Adolph incorporates blockchain technology in the form of NFTs, adding a dimension
    of functionality to his work. For Art Cologne, Florian Adolph has created a series
    of 10 signed prints on paper for us. Owners of one of these physical prints will
    receive the corresponding NFT as a digital original through provinz.digital.
    Additionally, we will release 10 NFT \"PrintingBlocks\" on the Ethereum and WAX
    blockchains. Each \"PrintingBlock\" is a unique piece that automatically generates
    a new digital unique print each month for one year starting on January 1, 2022.
    Through this functional reference to printing plates and prints, Florian Adolph
    highlights the equal significance of analog and digital processes in his work.
    Florian is a co-founder of WAVA."

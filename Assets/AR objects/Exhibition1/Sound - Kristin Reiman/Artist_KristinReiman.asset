  Description: "Kristin Reiman works with the notion of discomfort, malfunctions,
    and the skewing of perception using sound, speech, and writing. Their works often
    take the form of audio plays or mock-versions of bigger musical forms, where
    one or multiple voices lament trivial problems and cyclical thoughts. Reiman
    graduated from St\xE4delschule and the Estonian Academy of Arts with additional
    studies at the Royal Academy of Arts Antwerp. Their latest works include choir
    pieces How to unfocus completely (2022, B15, Linz) and Artist\u2019s Lament (2021,
    CEAAC, Strasbourg), as well as several music releases as Man Rei. As a resident
    of Noods Radio, Reiman runs a bi-monthly radio show called An Awkward Guest."

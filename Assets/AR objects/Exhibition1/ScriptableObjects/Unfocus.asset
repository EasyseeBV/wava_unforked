  Description: "Over and over again, in different harmonies and arrangements, Kristin
    Reiman\u2019s choir\r\npiece spreads and expands in space and time, erupting
    in the middle and dissolving\r\nslowly towards the edges. Like formalistic mantras,
    the repeating sentences gain and\r\nlose meaning as the piece develops. Gradually,
    we lose track of the words themselves\r\nand find ourselves in a pool of sonic
    waves, tightening and loosening infrequently.\r\nUnder the towering Deutsche
    Bank Towers, overseeing a market running to the beat of\r\nmillisecond-activity
    and a never-ending flux of capital, the tiny hilltop in the\r\nTaunusanlage becomes
    a place of refuge. The emanating sounds cast a spell-like effect\r\non the surrounding,
    fighting off the demand for constant productivity and allowing us for\r\na moment
    to immerse ourselves in the magical soundscape of \u201CHow to unfocus\r\ncompletely\u201D."

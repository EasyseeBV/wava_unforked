  Description: "Composed especially for the Nizza Garden path together with musician
    Alexander Iezzi, Tanya V. Abelson orchestrated a sonic arrangement for two of
    Abelson\u2019s sculptures \u2013 Tambourine and Sunburn Drum. The two large-scale
    percussion instruments are made of metal, rubber, and leather and carry a powerful
    sense of materiality. The sounds produced haunt the beaten path, carrying along
    the echoes of the instruments which created them.\r\n \r\nThe unique, enchanting
    soundtrack makes the plants' edginess feasible. It becomes a score of the path
    and its flora dwellers, most of whom are non-native to the region and were imported
    especially to create this garden of southern fantasies. \r\n"

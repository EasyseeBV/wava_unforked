  Description: Les Trucs is a collaboration between Charlotte Simon and Toben Piel,
    who have been working together since 2008. Their works, whether it's sound concepts
    for urban spaces, compositions for a moving paper choir, or a basement bar, are
    always related to the surrounding spaces and situations. Les Trucs perform in
    DIY structures as well as in contexts of performing and visual arts. They have
    collaborated with choreographers and directors such as Meg Stuart, Philippe Quesne,
    contact Gonzo, Schorsch Kamerun, and Eisa Jocson, and have played concerts across
    Europe, Russia, Israel, and Japan. Together with Benjamin Bascom, they run MMODEMM,
    a cassette label for experimental electronic dance music. In 2020, they founded
    Wheel of Fortune, another label that releases conceptual music in connection
    with 3D-printed objects.

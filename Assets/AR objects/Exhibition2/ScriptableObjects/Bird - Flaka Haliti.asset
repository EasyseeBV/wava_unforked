  Description: "A bird in landing, perching delicately in a balanced momentum. Flaka
    Haliti's creature in perpetual arrival blurs the lines between the powerful and
    the powerless, the oppressor and the oppressed, the real and the imaginary. Its
    bone structure is a fuse of an Eagle and a Pigeon, embodying the symbol of German
    self-consciousness and the resilience of a common bird, embracing in-betweenness
    as a fundamental aspect of existence and a survival tactic. Rather than submitting
    to analysis and to the viewer's gaze, the bird stands as an opaque and enigmatic
    figure, coated, covered by snow that fell. Or has always been there? An archaeological
    remnant or a futuristic fantasy, this bird is a symbol in and of itself. \n\nComputational
    designer - Martino Hutz"

  Description: "Marlene Garcia-Esperat, a chemist in the Philippine's Department
    of Agriculture, uncovered political grafting by government officials and was
    later appointed as ombudsman. Despite being on a witness protection program due
    to death threats, she continued to expose corruption through media outlets. She
    was murdered in her home in 2005 by agriculture officials whom she had investigated
    for years over their corrupt dealings, including the embezzlement of millions
    from government contracts.\n\nMonuments of the Disclosed is a series of digital
    monuments dedicated to whistleblowers who stood up to forces far beyond themselves.
    In recent years, doubts have been raised around the question of who is honoured
    in monumental form, with military generals, philanthropic merchants, and well-connected
    politicians being the most common choices for statues, which serve as towering
    exclamation points in the urban landscape, emphasising what and whose \"history\"
    has deemed important. In \xD6\u011F\xFCt\u2019s monuments, the busts hover over
    the plinths, making one wonder if they are about to land or be removed. They
    exist in a perpetual state of transition. Monuments are built, and monuments
    are toppled. \n\nIn 2022 \xD6\u011F\xFCt collaborated with Artwrld to create
    a collection of digital monuments to lesser-known whistleblowers. Individuals
    who, often at tremendous personal sacrifice, exposed the fraud, malintent and
    wrongdoing of unfettered power; and who, more often than not, remain unrecognized
    for their acts of courage.\n\nFor DEMO-, five of these monuments were placed
    in context-specific locations in the public space of Frankfurt: at the IG Farben
    Building (Kimberly Young-McLe), the Chinese Consulate-General (Li Wenliang),
    the Philippine Consulate General (Marlene Garcia-Esperat), the Frankfurt Dom
    (Philip Saviano) and at the GPS Reference Point (Aaron Swartz).\n"

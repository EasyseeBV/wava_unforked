  Description: "Tap the coins!\n\nSilver coins minted by German princes rain down
    from above as symbols of their power. Tapping the coins turn them into the constitutional
    documents of the National Assembly in the Paulskirche. The \u201CRevolutionary
    March\u201D by Johann Strauss Jr. plays in the background.\nOver time, the music
    becomes more and more discordant. Gold coins minted by the Prussian king and
    Austrian emperor begin to fall from the sky. Tapping the gold coins play Prussian
    and Austrian victory marches, e.g. \u201CPrussians\u2019 Glory\u201D by Johann
    Gottfried Piefke and the \u201CRadetzky March\u201D by Johann Strauss Sr.\n\nGradually,
    the gold coins, symbols of Prussian and Austrian power, bury the documents of
    the revolution, leaving only the jingling sounds of gold coins falling.\n\nThe
    Revolution of 1848 began in the Grand Duchy of Baden and spread to the other
    states of the federation within a few weeks. From Berlin to Vienna, the revolution
    forced autocratic monarchs to appoint liberal governments (the \"March Cabinets\")
    in the individual states, and hold elections to a constituent National Assembly.
    This met on May 18, 1848, in the Paulskirche in the then-free city of Frankfurt
    am Main. The National Assembly established a central government and saw itself
    as the parliament of a revolutionary, nascent democratic German Empire.\n\nAfter
    initial democratic reforms in March 1848 (abolition of press censorship, liberation
    of the peasants), the revolutionary movement came increasingly under attack from
    reactionary forces. By July 1849, predominantly Prussian and Austrian troops
    had used military force to crush the first attempt to create a democratically
    constituted, unified German nation-state."

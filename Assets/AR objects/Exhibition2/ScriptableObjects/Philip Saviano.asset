  Description: "Phillip Saviano's brave decision to approach The Boston Globe with
    his story of being abused by a Catholic priest was a pivotal moment in the fight
    against the systemic abuse of children by priests. Suffering from the AIDS virus
    and believing he was near the end of his life, Saviano risked everything to speak
    out and expose the truth about the church's misconduct. His actions not only
    brought attention to his own experience but also paved the way for other victims
    to\n\nMonuments of the Disclosed is a series of digital monuments dedicated to
    whistleblowers who stood up to forces far beyond themselves. In recent years,
    doubts have been raised around the question of who is honoured in monumental
    form, with military generals, philanthropic merchants, and well-connected politicians
    being the most common choices for statues, which serve as towering exclamation
    points in the urban landscape, emphasising what and whose \"history\" has deemed
    important. In \xD6\u011F\xFCt\u2019s monuments, the busts hover over the plinths,
    making one wonder if they are about to land or be removed. They exist in a perpetual
    state of transition. Monuments are built, and monuments are toppled. \n\nIn 2022
    \xD6\u011F\xFCt collaborated with Artwrld to create a collection of digital monuments
    to lesser-known whistleblowers. Individuals who, often at tremendous personal
    sacrifice, exposed the fraud, malintent and wrongdoing of unfettered power; and
    who, more often than not, remain unrecognized for their acts of courage.\n\nFor
    DEMO-, five of these monuments were placed in context-specific locations in the
    public space of Frankfurt: at the IG Farben Building (Kimberly Young-McLe), the
    Chinese Consulate-General (Li Wenliang), the Philippine Consulate General (Marlene
    Garcia-Esperat), the Frankfurt Dom (Philip Saviano) and at the GPS Reference
    Point (Aaron Swartz).\n"

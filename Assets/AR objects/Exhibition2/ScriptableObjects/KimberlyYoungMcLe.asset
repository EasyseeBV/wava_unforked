  Description: "Kimberly Young-McLear, a highly decorated senior military officer
    and tech expert, faced workplace bullying, harassment, discrimination, and retaliation
    due to her intelligence, race, gender, and sexuality, during her tenure at the
    Coast Guard Academy from 2014-2018. The Homeland Security Inspector General found
    that the Coast Guard violated numerous policies and federal retaliation laws.
    Her bravery led to over 30 Coast Guard policy reforms, key passages in the 2020
    Elijah E. Cummings Coast Guard Authorization Act, and two national defence bipartisan
    laws. Still, there has been no justice in her case.\n\nMonuments of the Disclosed
    is a series of digital monuments dedicated to whistleblowers who stood up to
    forces far beyond themselves. In recent years, doubts have been raised around
    the question of who is honoured in monumental form, with military generals, philanthropic
    merchants, and well-connected politicians being the most common choices for statues,
    which serve as towering exclamation points in the urban landscape, emphasising
    what and whose \"history\" has deemed important. In \xD6\u011F\xFCt\u2019s monuments,
    the busts hover over the plinths, making one wonder if they are about to land
    or be removed. They exist in a perpetual state of transition. Monuments are built,
    and monuments are toppled. \n\nIn 2022 \xD6\u011F\xFCt collaborated with Artwrld
    to create a collection of digital monuments to lesser-known whistleblowers. Individuals
    who, often at tremendous personal sacrifice, exposed the fraud, malintent and
    wrongdoing of unfettered power; and who, more often than not, remain unrecognized
    for their acts of courage.\n\nFor DEMO-, five of these monuments were placed
    in context-specific locations in the public space of Frankfurt: at the IG Farben
    Building (Kimberly Young-McLe), the Chinese Consulate-General (Li Wenliang),
    the Philippine Consulate General (Marlene Garcia-Esperat), the Frankfurt Dom
    (Philip Saviano) and at the GPS Reference Point (Aaron Swartz).\n"

  Description: "Morehshin Allahyari\u2019s 3D sculpture Zoba'ah: The Whirlwind, is
    based on drawings of the jinn Zoba'ah dating back to the 14th and 16th centuries.
    In Islamic and pre-Islamic theology, jinn are intelligent spirits are shape-shifters
    created from smokeless fire. They inhabit a parallel world and are one of the
    three sentient creatures created by Allah, along with humans and angels. Unlike
    angels, jinn have their own agency and free will and can lean towards both good
    and evil. They are said to appear in from of humans when catastrophes occur.\n\nZoba\u2019ah
    , one of the most powerful jinn known for bringing immediate change, is summoned
    by the artist to Frankfurt and brought into the hybrid space of the Eiserner
    Steg. Zoba'ah: The Whirlwind invites you to contribute to or participate in the
    project in the form of a series of small daily actions (referred to as micro-actions)
    to create bigger collective goals and changes in the world (referred to as macro-influences).\n\nUSER

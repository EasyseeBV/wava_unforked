  Description: "In December 2019, Li Wenliang warned fellow doctors on WeChat about
    a SARS-like disease outbreak. His message was leaked on social media, leading
    to accusations of spreading false rumours and interrogations by the Wuhan police.
    In February 2020 Li contracted and dies from what was then understood to be Covid-19.
    He was later exonerated and recognised as a \"martyr\" by the Chinese government.\n\nMonuments
    of the Disclosed is a series of digital monuments dedicated to whistleblowers
    who stood up to forces far beyond themselves. In recent years, doubts have been
    raised around the question of who is honoured in monumental form, with military
    generals, philanthropic merchants, and well-connected politicians being the most
    common choices for statues, which serve as towering exclamation points in the
    urban landscape, emphasising what and whose \"history\" has deemed important.
    In \xD6\u011F\xFCt\u2019s monuments, the busts hover over the plinths, making
    one wonder if they are about to land or be removed. They exist in a perpetual
    state of transition. Monuments are built, and monuments are toppled. \n\nIn 2022
    \xD6\u011F\xFCt collaborated with Artwrld to create a collection of digital monuments
    to lesser-known whistleblowers. Individuals who, often at tremendous personal
    sacrifice, exposed the fraud, malintent and wrongdoing of unfettered power; and
    who, more often than not, remain unrecognized for their acts of courage.\n\nFor
    DEMO-, five of these monuments were placed in context-specific locations in the
    public space of Frankfurt: at the IG Farben Building (Kimberly Young-McLe), the
    Chinese Consulate-General (Li Wenliang), the Philippine Consulate General (Marlene
    Garcia-Esperat), the Frankfurt Dom (Philip Saviano) and at the GPS Reference
    Point (Aaron Swartz).\n"

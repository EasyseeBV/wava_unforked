  Description: "Aaron Swartz was a computer programmer, activist, and entrepreneur
    who advocated for free and open access to internet resources. He co-founded Demand
    Progress and developed SecureDrop. Swartz also provided free access to federal
    court documents and founded Watchdog.net. He then faced charges of wire fraud
    and violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 2011 for accessing JSTOR with
    an MIT account and downloading over 4.8 million documents. He was at risk of
    facing a $1 million penalty, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution,
    and supervised release if convicted. Swartz died by suicide in 2013 after failing
    to reach an acceptable plea bargain.\n\nMonuments of the Disclosed is a series
    of digital monuments dedicated to whistleblowers who stood up to forces far beyond
    themselves. In recent years, doubts have been raised around the question of who
    is honoured in monumental form, with military generals, philanthropic merchants,
    and well-connected politicians being the most common choices for statues, which
    serve as towering exclamation points in the urban landscape, emphasising what
    and whose \"history\" has deemed important. In \xD6\u011F\xFCt\u2019s monuments,
    the busts hover over the plinths, making one wonder if they are about to land
    or be removed. They exist in a perpetual state of transition. Monuments are built,
    and monuments are toppled. \n\nIn 2022 \xD6\u011F\xFCt collaborated with Artwrld
    to create a collection of digital monuments to lesser-known whistleblowers. Individuals
    who, often at tremendous personal sacrifice, exposed the fraud, malintent and
    wrongdoing of unfettered power; and who, more often than not, remain unrecognized
    for their acts of courage.\n\nFor DEMO-, five of these monuments were placed
    in context-specific locations in the public space of Frankfurt: at the IG Farben
    Building (Kimberly Young-McLe), the Chinese Consulate-General (Li Wenliang),
    the Philippine Consulate General (Marlene Garcia-Esperat), the Frankfurt Dom
    (Philip Saviano) and at the GPS Reference Point (Aaron Swartz).\n"

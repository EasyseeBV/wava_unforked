  Description: "Tony Cokes lives and works in Providence, Rhode Island, where he
    serves as Professor in the Department of Modern Culture and Media at Brown University.
    Hor over 30 years, has explored the impact of political ideologies in media and
    pop culture on society, using a unique language for video essays that rejects
    representative imagery. Through found text fragments and pop music, his audiovisual
    works challenge conventional forms of perception and trace historical continuities,
    making reading discourses on structural racism, capitalism, warfare, and gentrification
    a bodily and public experience. In 2022, he was the subject of a major survey
    jointly organized by the Haus der Kunst and Kunstverein in Munich. Other recent
    solo exhibitions include De Balie, Amsterdam (2022); Greene Naftali, New York
    (2022, 2018); Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, Rochester (2021);
    MACRO Contemporary Art Museum, Rome (2021); CIRCA, London (2021); Museu d\u2019Art
    Contemporani de Barcelona, Barcelona (2020); ARGOS centre for audiovisual arts,
    Brussels (2020); Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Harvard University, Cambridge,
    Massachusetts (2020); BAK \u2013 basis voor actuele kunst, Utrecht, Netherlands
    (2020); Luma Westbau, Zurich (2019); Goldsmiths Centre for Contemporary Art,
    London (2019); The Shed, New York (2019); Kunsthall Bergen, Norway (2018); and

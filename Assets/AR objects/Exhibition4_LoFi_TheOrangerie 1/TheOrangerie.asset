  Description: "The Gr\xFCneburgpark is the largest park in Frankfurt. For almost
    a century, it belonged to the Rothschild family, who had built an Orangerie on
    its grounds. In 1935, the park was seized by the Nazi city administration and
    opened to the public the following year. Albert von Goldschmidt-Rothschild, the
    last resident of the estate, fled to Switzerland and took his own life in 1941.\n\nAppearing
    in their contemporary form around the mid-16th century, Orangeries function as
    winter housing for citrus and other detached southern plants that were not made
    to survive the northern climate. Being almost entirely inter-fertile, citrus
    plants have entangled histories of becoming, from East Asia to Sevilla via the
    Arab Agriculture Revolution. A well-known composite is the Jaffa orange. First
    cultivated by Arab farmers in the mid-19th century, the orange named after the
    city in whose markets it first appeared became an agricultural focus for the
    growing Jewish settlement. For some time, ties between Arab and Jewish farmers
    and exporters proved strong even amidst the growing tensions. Then, what was
    an image of return for some became a symbol of disaster for others. \n\nWhat
    powers do images have in processing composite realities and cultivating political
    imaginaries? The Orangerie presents a collection of video works that fuse documentary
    and fiction in an attempt to observe and understand complex entanglements. Emerging
    from concrete political and social environments, the artists explore various
    image-making tools to break through the seen world. Appearing along a circular
    path within the park through Augmented Reality, the videos virtually inhabit
    the physical space together, without separability. \n\nHinda Weiss\u2019s Frankfurt
    Notes (2019) was filmed in Frankfurt, around the park and its memorial rose garden.
    By collaging video footage into a single frame, she creates an image of Frankfurt
    that spans from the present to the past. Creating a space both real and imaginary,
    the video weaves together pieces of sedimented Jewish history of loss and displacement
    into a seemingly idle scene, not unlike the park itself. In Epiphanie (2023),
    Muhammad Toukhy's video work presents an image reminiscent of neorealistic cinema
    combined with the jaggedness and eerieness of a drone camera. Toukhy's video
    explores the custom of retrieving a cross thrown into the water at St. Peter's
    Church in Jaffa, known for its unusual westward orientation. This orientation
    prompts reflections on Jaffa's deep connection to the sea and the West, as well
    as the distinctive Palestinian identity in this enclave surrounded by Israeli
    neighbourhoods\u2014a constant invocation of nostalgia and grief.\n\nTrembling
    Time (2001) by Yael Bartana captures and moulds a moment of silence during Israel's
    Memorial Day from a bridge overlooking traffic. As the commemorative siren sounds,
    driving cars slow to a halt, and passengers step out and stand still before resuming
    their journey. Bartana uses slow motion, repetition, and cross-fading to create
    a layered, critical reflection on the ritual, exposing the ghostly omnipresence
    of collective trauma. Bidoon Enwan (Untitled, 2009), in Arabic \u0628\u0650\u062F\u0648\u0646
    \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646, means both \"without an address\" and \"untitled.\"
    In the video, the artist Raafat Hattab tends to an olive tree, connecting with
    the memory and yearning for a return to a place that was. As the camera zooms
    out, the space around is revealed, anchoring the old tree in Rabin Square in
    the middle of paved contemporary Tel Aviv\u2013\u2013exposing the state of being
    detached while remaining rooted in place. \n\nAs extreme winds blow, The Orangerie
    seeks to shelter and hold open possible spaces of encounter. Within the covered-up
    wound-space of the Gr\xFCneburgpark, the video works coexist, different yet inseparable,
    bound by ceaseless storms of histories and the continuously generated trauma
    of displacement and loss. "

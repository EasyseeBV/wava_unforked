  Description: 'Epiphany is a Christian holiday that marks the occurrences of the
    Magi''s visit, Jesus''s baptism, and the wedding at Cana. In certain regions
    like Palestine, a unique custom takes place during this holiday, involving a
    competition where men and boys strive to retrieve a cross thrown into the water
    by a priest. The one who retrieves the cross first is believed to receive a special
    blessing.

    In this work, a processed archival video illustrates this custom
    being observed at St. Peter''s Church in Old Jaffa. This church stands out due
    to its uncommon westward orientation, unlike the typical east-facing apses of
    other churches. The video raises questions about the profound ties between Jaffa,
    its connection to the sea and the West, as well as the unique status of the people
    of Palestine residing in Jaffa. Unlike other Palestinian communities, they find
    themselves surrounded by Israeli settlements and the sea, a recurring reminder
    of their link to the sea on one hand, and the anxiety of exile on the other.

    The
    Jaffa port carries both nostalgic and traumatic significance for Palestinians.
    It is associated with certain myths and holds a pivotal role in the labour history
    of Jaffa''s residents. Simultaneously, it serves as the point of initial contact
    for Jewish colonizers approaching the city, symbolizing a place that welcomes
    both the good and the bad. This notion of incoming entities is mirrored in the
    foundational story of St. Peter''s Church. A church that was constructed on the
    site where the house of Simon the Tanner was traditionally located. According
    to the New Testament, St. Peter arrived in Jaffa following the passing of a devout
    woman named Tabitha. In a remarkable mystical event, he called her back to life
    through prayer.

    Subsequently, St. Peter remained in Jaffa, residing in the
    house of Simon the Tanner. During his time there, he experienced a vision on
    the rooftop, where he was urged by an angel to consume various animals, including
    creatures traditionally considered impure. This vision played a role in challenging
    kosher laws and promoting Christian outreach to non-Jewish communities during
    that era. In fact, the positioning of the apse in the church symbolizes the path
    taken by the announcing angel.'

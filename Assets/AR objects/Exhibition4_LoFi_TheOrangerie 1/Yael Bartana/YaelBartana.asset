  Description: "Yael Bartana is an observer of the contemporary and a pre-enactor.
    She employs art as a scalpel inside the mechanisms of power structures and navigates
    the fine and crackled line between the sociological and the imagination. In her
    films, installations, photographs, staged performances, and public monuments
    she investigates subjects like national identity, trauma, and displacement, often
    through ceremonies, memorials, public rituals, and collective gatherings.   
    Her work has been exhibited worldwide, including (solo exhibitions) GL Strand
    Copenhagen(2024); Jewish Museum Berlin (2021), Fondazione Modena Arti Visive
    (2019/2020); Philadelphia Museum of Art (2018); Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (2015);

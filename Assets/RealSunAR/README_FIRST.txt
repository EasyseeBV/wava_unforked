Hello and thank you for using RealSunAR.

IMPORTANT: In case you were using an older version please remove the folders "/RealSun/ARCore" and "/RealSun/AR Foundation"
as this new version is made to work with ALL AR SDK/Toolkits out of the box!

As much as I'd love to include demo scenes that was impossible because I have no idea which AR SDK you will be using and which version of Unity.
What I have done though, was write thorough instructions of how to create your own demo scene in some easy steps!

For any questions feel free to write RealSunAR@gmail.com
or just post on the support forum: https://forum.unity.com/threads/realsunar-sun-and-shadows-matching-the-real-world-on-your-ar-project.695338/

Have fun developing with RealSunAR!
